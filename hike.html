                <img src="./images/kids_moriah_challenge.jpg">
                <p>
                    The Moriah Chamber of Commerce is pleased to announce the "Moriah Challenge" is off to a great
                    start!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To complete the "Moriah Challenge" hikers must complete all four local Champlain Area Trails (CATS)
                    hikes, which include Belfry Mountain, Big Hollow/Coot Hill, Cheney Mountain, and Crowfoot Pond
                    trails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone who successfully completes the challenge and submits their information will receive a
                    commemorative embroidered patch to celebrate their accomplishment. To claim a patch, hikers should
                    provide the Moriah Chamber of Commerce with the dates the trails were hiked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Moriah Chamber is accepting donations for the challenge patches, with a suggested donation of
                    $10.00 per participant. The donation ensures we are able to able to keep the Moriah Challenge going,
                    no matter how
                    many hikers complete it. Due to the finite funds that we can raise for patches, and the overwhelming
                    response to the challenge last year, we ran out of patches early in the season and had to disappoint
                    many hikers who asked for them. We feel the donation system is a fair way to make sure patches are
                    available for everyone who completes the challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Successful challenge participants should claim their patch by bringing their hike information and
                    donation to Chamber Offices at:

                    Following are brief descriptions of the hikes that comprise the challenge:
                </p>

                <a href="https://www.lakechamplainregion.com/hiking/belfry-mountain" target="_blank">
                    <h3>Belfry Mountain Trail</h3>
                </a>
                <p>
                    The trail is an easy, quick hike that rewards hikers with views of the high peaks of the
                    Adirondacks, the Green Mountains of Vermont, plus the Champlain Valley, then Belfry Mountain. The
                    trail also features a fire tower. Belfry Mountain Trail is a short 0.35 mile hike along a gravel
                    road with spectacular views.
                </p>

                <a href="https://www.lakechamplainregion.com/hiking/coot-hill-big-hollow-trail" target="_blank">
                    <h3>Big Hollow/Coot Hill Trail</h3>
                </a>
                <p>
                    Hikers can walk along an un-maintained portion of Lang Road or drive the rough road to an old
                    cemetery.
                    From the cemetery, the hike is about a quarter mile to an amazing overlook. This 0.5 mile round trip
                    will rewards hikers with stunning views of Big Hollow and a panoramic vista of the Champlain Valley.
                </p>
                <a href="https://www.lakechamplainregion.com/hiking/cheney-mountain-trail" target="_blank">
                    <h3>Cheney Mountain Trail</h3>
                </a>
                <p>

                    The trail is located on property owned by the Town of Moriah. Views from lookouts along side trails
                    near the 1,347 foot summit include the Green Mountains of Vermont to the east and some of the
                    Adirondack High Peaks to the west. The total round trip of this hike is two miles.
                </p>
                <a href="https://www.lakechamplainregion.com/hiking/crowfoot-pond-trail" target="_blank">
                    <h3>Crowfoot Pond Trail</h3>
                </a>
                <p>
                    The six mile trail is relatively flat with only a slight gain in elevation. This old forest road
                    turned foot trail starts to climb through an evergreen forest as it passes over the low shoulder of
                    Stiles Hill on the left. The trail reaches the pond and passes beyond it. The trail eventually ends
                    at private property on the north Shore of Crowfoot Pond, marking the point for the return hike.
                </p>
